            <h2>3D Printed Dice Tower and Holder</h2>
            <p>Another class that was taken during my last semester of school was a 3D printing class that taught us how to model on Fusion 360 and use those files on prusaslicer to take and print on a Prusa MK3S+. The basics of printing, troubleshooting, and modeling were taught in this class to be able to take a 3D printer and print out whatever we wanted as long as we modeled or found a model online. For the final project, we were tasked with printing out a design that was fully designed by us. For my final project, I designed a DnD dice holder as well as a DnD dice roller that was based off of a tower from the game Legend of Zelda Wind Waker. I have used this tower many times and works very well and is also very fun to use. I designed the dice tower and dice holder in Fusion 360 and printed them out in PLA on the Prusa MK3S+. In total, the prints took about 30 hours to print and was a great learning experience for designing objects in Fusion 360.
