  <p class="projects__row-content-desc">
    This project was assigned as a final project for a PCB making and printing class in my last semester of school at Chapman University. The object of this project was to first design a schematic that would fit using the parts that we were provided with to create a robot that moves forward until an arduino ultrasonic sensor picks up an object in front of it. When that happens, it will move back and then look around to see if there are any objects around it and if it picks up another object to the side, it will turn to go to the otherside. The code for the arduino was provided and the parts were provided, but we needed to create a schematic on Eagle, then translate it to a board file that did not leave any airwires not connected, and then print the PCB and solder the parts together so that the robot worked when connected to the arduino.
