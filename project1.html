    This robot was created as a project for my microelectronics class to use PCB parts and strictly no microcontrollers to create a robot that follows a black line. This was done by using two infrared sensors that were passed through an inverter to have the motors turn on when there is non black light and the motors will stop when the infrared sensors pass over the black tape. The chassis of the robot was also 3D printed and found on thingiverse and was put together using screws and bolts to hold the battery holder and PCB inside of the chassis. The robot works by having the battery pack connect to a switch and when the switch is turned on, power is passed to the infrared sensors and turned on when non-black light is detected. This is done by passing the sensors through a not gate and connecting to two N-channel MOSFETS that connect to the motors and in turn move the robot while following the black line and correcting itself by turning the motors on and off. This project was also used in our engineering schoolâ€™s engineering competition called the Chapman University Make-A-Thon.
