            <p>I was an Electrical Engineering major who graduated from Chapman University in the Fall of 2023. I also minored in Environmental Science and was a four year starter on the Chapman University Football Team
            as the starting kicker. Through playing football, I was able to learn how to manage my time well with Electrical Engineering classes along side practicing, games, as well as training.</p>
