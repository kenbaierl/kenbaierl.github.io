              This robot was created as a project for my microelectronics class to use PCB parts and strictly no microcontrollers to create a robot that follows a black line. This was done by using two infrared sensors that were passed through an inverter to have the motors turn on when there is non black light and the motors will stop when the infrared sensors pass over the black tape. The chassis of the robot was also 3D printed and found on thingiverse and was put together using screws and bolts to hold the battery holder and PCB inside of the chassis. The robot works by having the battery pack connect to a switch and when the switch is turned on, power is passed to the infrared sensors and turned on when non-black light is detected. This is done by passing the sensors through a not gate and connecting to two N-channel MOSFETS that connect to the motors and in turn move the robot while following the black line and correcting itself by turning the motors on and off. This project was also used in our engineering schoolâ€™s engineering competition called the Chapman University Make-A-Thon.

              This project was assigned as a final project for a PCB making and printing class in my last semester of school at Chapman University. The object of this project was to first design a schematic that would fit using the parts that we were provided with to create a robot that moves forward until an arduino ultrasonic sensor picks up an object in front of it. When that happens, it will move back and then look around to see if there are any objects around it and if it picks up another object to the side, it will turn to go to the otherside. The code for the arduino was provided and the parts were provided, but we needed to create a schematic on Eagle, then translate it to a board file that did not leave any airwires not connected, and then print the PCB and solder the parts together so that the robot worked when connected to the arduino.

              The objective of this project was to understand the control system and make a block diagram of the wind turbine with disturbances and errors to account for while also finding the control system equation. Next, we need to find what kind of controller we need to use, be it a P, PI, PD, or PID controller to be able to account for all of the disturbances and errors in the project. We then had to find the design specifications including percent overshoot, settling time, rise time, steady-state error, and sensitivity by using the overall equation of the system. To find all of the design specifications and check the feedback and see which controller actually worked with the wind turbine, we used MATLAB to make visuals of the design specifications.

            Another class that was taken during my last semester of school was a 3D printing class that taught us how to model on Fusion 360 and use those files on prusaslicer to take and print on a Prusa MK3S+. The basics of printing, troubleshooting, and modeling were taught in this class to be able to take a 3D printer and print out whatever we wanted as long as we modeled or found a model online.
